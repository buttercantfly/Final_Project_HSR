## HSR Booking System

This project is the final assignment for the ESOE OOP course, developed in Java.

It is a simple (very simple) high-speed rail booking system that supports the following basic operations:
- Ticket booking
- Ticket information inquiry

The ticket booking system ensures seat availability and allows users to book tickets based on their identity (with applicable discounts) and seat preference (window or aisle).

Additionally, users can retrieve ticket information using either their ID or the ticket number provided by the system after booking.
