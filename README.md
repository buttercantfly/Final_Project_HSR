## Simple HSR Ticket Booking System
This project is the final project for the ESOE OOP course.

It is a simple high-speed rail booking system which supports the following basic operations:
- Ticket booking
- Ticket information inquiry

The ticket booking system ensures seat availability and allows users to book tickets based on identity (with applicable discounts) and seat preference (window or aisle).

Additionally, you can retrieve ticket information by using either your ID or the ticket number provided by the system after booking.
